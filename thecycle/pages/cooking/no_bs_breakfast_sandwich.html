    <p> This meal is perfectly designed for people who want <b>convenient</b> food, without sacrificing the <b>quality</b> of their food.
      We don't always have the time in our days to labor behind the stovetop for an hour to produce a beautiful looking meal.
      Ideally, we would, but life in some way or another will occasionally impede this idealism.
      However, life shall never get the best of me because today I am making my <b>No BS Breakfast-Sandwich</b>
      (hold the applause for crafty wordplay). <p/>

    <p> It's really simple. Almost too simple. It feels like cooking is a test that we are cheating on type of simple.
      You want to start by toasting your <b>bread of choice</b>. I personally am a fan of multigrain or oatmeal bread because these breads
      are full of delicious healthy carbs and have a really good fluffy texture. </p>

      <p>While your bread is toasting, you want to be preparing your eggs.
        Grab the smallest bowl-like container you have in your cupboard, crack an egg in there,
        and pop it in the microwave for no more than <b>20 seconds</b>.
        I realize that cooking eggs in the microwave is unconventional, but, like I said, <b>super simple</b>.
      The only caveat here, is that you don't want to <b>over microwave</b> your egg, because you'll hear a loud pop, which is the
      egg white exploding (I'm telling you this because I've hurt <b>far too many innocent eggs</b> making this meal).</p>
      <p>To prevent this catastrophe, microwave for 20 seconds and then take a look at your egg.
      You want to judge the firmness of the egg based on how runny you prefer your eggs to be.
      If you prefer runny, then err on the side of less firm and vice versa.
      If your egg is not firm enough, then put the egg back in the microwave for about <b>6 seconds</b> and keep repeating this process
      until you get your desired egg.</p>

        <p>If you want to keep this as a <b>sandwich</b>, I would only cook 1 egg,
          however if you want to turn this into a <b>toast</b> ensemble (as pictured above), then I would cook 2 eggs.
          Just make sure to cook the eggs seperately if the toast route is your jam (again, hold the applause).</p>

          <p>By now, your toast should be done. Throw on any ingredients you wish.
            Personally, I'll throw on a slice of goulda cheese and a slice, or two, of turkey on each piece of bread.
            Cheese and eggs is a no brainer and the turkey is there because any proper sandwich has to have turkey, right? </p>

            <p>After giving your eggs enough time to cool off and take their shape, you want to put them <b>on top</b> of your bread concoction.
              The order should be: bread, cheese, turkey, and then egg.
              This is because you want your cheese to <b>melt</b> to your bread, and you want
              the egg on top for stability purposes (you don't want your sandwich falling over now, do you?).</p>

              <p>Again, you're going to put both pieces of your sandwich/toast,
                with all the ingredients on top of them, in the microwave for
              about 30-45 seconds.
              At this point, you want to finish by adding some salt and pepper and any other spices and sauces to your meal.
              This is your meal, so feel free to add whatever you would like.
              I know a lot of people are fans of the hot sauce condiment when trying to spice up their breakfast.
              I'm personally not the biggest advocate, but
              I'll finish the meal by throwing in a <b>side of fruit</b>, just because every meal I try to incorporate at least 1 fruit or veggie.</p>

              <p>This meal has the healhy <b>fats</b> in your eggs/cheese, <b>proteins</b> in your turkey/eggs,
                and <b>carbs</b> in your toast/fruit.
                We are all about <b>balanced meals</b> over here at thecycle.</p>

                <p>This meal takes literally no more than 3 minutes to make.
                <b>Super simple</b>.
                With that being said, make sure to enjoy the sandwich, certainly without the BS, and thank you for reading!</p>

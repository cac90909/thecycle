        <h3 class="service__header">A: Chris Codes</h3>
        <p>Being able to transform abstract conepts to physical ideas on a digital
           screen is something that I way too frequently find myself getting lost
           in time doing. Ever since I was a kid, I have been a big fan of puzzles,
           and working on code provides myself the opportunity to utilize my problem
           solving skills on projects I find conceptually fascinating and mentally
           stimulating. Some of the areas I gravitate towards are machine learning
           learning, data science, and data visualization. </p>

        <h3 class="service__header">A: Chris Commentates</h3>
        <p>I wouldn't consider myself a literary connoisseur, but I love ending the
           day by reading something both engaging and compelling. Reading has been
           an acquired taste for me, but being able to connect to a novel's characters
           and witness their development in response to sequential plot events will
           often have me not wanting to put the book down. Naturally, some of my
           favorite genres include sci-fi, non-fiction, and comedy.</p>

      <div class = "service">
        <h3 class="service__header">A: Chris Cooks</h3>
        <p>Getting acquainted with the kitchen has also been a recent development in
           my life, but I would like to think I have dove head first into the pool of
           culinary creations. I'm personally not much of a recipe devotee (which
           might explain the quality of my cooking), so I love to experiment with
           the various ingredients I might have at the time. Some categories
           of food that I enjoy consuming and cooking the most are breakfast items,
           Indian cuisuine, and post-workout healthy deserts. </p>

    <div class ="about-me__body">
      <p>I have one goal in life: <b>happiness</b>. Everything that I do in life, whether
        being as small as the color of pen I use and then spanning as grand as my
        long term career ambitions, contributes to my overall happiness in some way,
        shape, or form. When everything contributes to the same end goal, it creates a
        <b>virtuous cycle</b>.</p>

        <p> To maintain this cycle, I follow the mantra that life is too short to be
        doing things that aren't fulfilling, so I try to only do the things that are.
        The point of this website is to share, with anyone interested, the
        things that I am passionate about because I think they are <b>awesome</b> and <b>worth
        sharing! </b></p>

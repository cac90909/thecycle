      <p> Nothing screams "comfort food" more than a freshly baked chicken pot pie with a blurry lens filter and a basket of fruit
        in the backdrop!
        Now that I have that cliche done and made fun of, I feel comfortable proceeding with the recipe. </p>

      <p> If I'm being fully transparent, chicken pot pies are not a food I would eat everyday, because there is a feeling
        of <b>Santa Claus-esque fullness</b> that proceeds this heavenly eating experience that is like no other.</p><p>
        Thus, chicken pot pies should be reserved for only special occassions, otherwise they would lose their appeal.
        It's like celebrating Easter everyday.
        You can only consume so many chocolate eggs until you are just labeled as <i>"that guy"</i>.
        <b>Nobody</b> wants to be <i> that guy </i>.</p>

      <p> ANYWAYS, you want to start this recipe out by simply <b>sauteeing</b> some onions over a bit of cooking oil.
        Lately, I've been trying to substitute water in for cooking oil because the point of cooking oil is to provide a liquid
        layer that seperates the food from the frying pan, so in my opinion water can do that same thing.
        Don't blame me if anything goes wrong, but water is always an option as well.

      <p> While these onions are sauteeing, you want to start heating up a <b>large saucepan.</b>
        You want a large enough saucepan to fit the filling of the chicken pot pie.
        When that pan heats up enough, you want to throw in a can of <b> cream of chicken </b> soup.
        If you want a <b> healthier </b> pot pie, I would only throw in half a can or no can at all and just substitute in chicken
        broth. </p>

      <p> Next, you want to throw in the rest of the <b>vegtebales</b> in your sautee pan.
        I recommend just buying a can of normal mixed vegtebales (peas, carrots, corn, etc.).
        Additionally, some people really enjoy <b>potatoes</b> with their pot pies, so consider adding that here as well.
         Keep them sauteeing and add <b>salt/pepper</b> to your desire.</p>
         <p>
        Next, throw some chicken into a bowl, season it with whatever you'd like.
        I wouldn't do anything crazy with seasoning here, although I am a big fan of <b> crazy </b>, so
        just salt and pepper the chicken evenly and then throw it into the <b>sautee pan</b> with the rest of the solid contents.
        I recommend just going with canned chicken here.
        Even though I get a lot of heat from my apartment roommates for using canned goods too often for my meals,
        it is honestly very cost efficient and it doesn't matter too too much on the quality of your meat for this recipe.
        Plus, the canned chicken comes pre sliced into <b>bite sized pieces</b>, which saves you some work.</p>

        <p> Once everything is properly sauteed, you want to throw all of your contents into the cream of chicken saucepan, which should
          be <b>near boil</b>.
          You don't want to get your pie filling too warm
          because your contents are going to be put into the pie and then baked in a second, so turn the heat
          on low because the point of this part is just to get the vegtebales and chicken <b>soaking</b> in the cream of chicken. </p>

        <p>While this is happening, you can go ahead and set up the <b>pie portion</b> of this meal.
          Get a circular pie pan and layout the pie around the circumference of this pan.
          You can either use premade pie crust or make your own.
          If you have the time, I would honestly recommend making your own pie crust using <b>almond flour</b>
          because it for sure helps to make this meal <b> healthier </b>.
          If I'm being honest, I've tried making my own pie crust, but everytime I kind of end up messing up the
          proportions (if you can't tell by the lack of specifications on ingredient quantity in my recipes, its because
          I don't really measure things out because I don't really follow recipes). </p>

          <p> Anyways, lay your pie out and make sure to flatten the edges of the pie.
            Once that is done, check in on your filling.
            Give it a <b>visual check.</b> Is it the <b> consistency </b> that you want?
            If too thick, add chicken stock. If too thin, add cream.
            Give it a <b>taste check.</b> Is it missing something?
            Well add it then.
            <b>Now is the time to throw in the spontaneous bacon bits!!!</b>
            Okay I honestly wouldn't do that, but that's just for health reasons.
            In an ideal world, my chicken pot pie would <b>ONLY</b> consist of bacon.
            And yes, I know what I just said....</p>

            <p>MOVING ON, once your filling passed the taste and visual check, take it out of the saucepan,
              <b>let it cool</b> for a minute or two so that it doesn't destory your fragile little pie crust, and then when
              the filling reaches a nice temp you can put it in the <b>pie pan.</b>
            </p><p>
              Make sure the pie looks pretty homogenous, throw in any last minute spices,
              and then <b>flatten</b> the top layer of filling in the pie.
              You want to put a <b>second pie crust</b> that goes on top of the pie.
              This top crust should <b>fold under</b> the bottom crust.
              Make sure you do this carefully as this is important for maintaing the structural integrity of your pie!
              But you do want your pie to still be able to breathe a little bit, so <b>poke some holes</b> in the center of your pie,
              so that it can release excess heat and not bubble up </p>

              <p> Throw that baby in the oven (not your actual baby, I was referring to the pot pie), take a 30 minute nap and then
                that baby should be ready to be devoured (again, not your actual baby...). </p>

              <p> Pot pies get a lot of feedback saying that they are too complicated and time consuming to make,
                but I wholeheartedly disagree with the pot pie haters.
                They're just mad because someone ate all of the bacon bits out of their pot pies. </p>

                <p> Anyways, it a pretty simple recipe. The pie should be done in 30 minutes.
                  Just check to see where the crust is at.
                  Pull it out a little bit before the crust is at your ideal level because
                  the pot pie will continue to bake for a couple minutes after being pulled out of the oven.
                  Let it cool for 5-10 minutes (actually do this, I know we can all be impatient, myself included
                  since I have been the victim of far too many burnt tongues from impatiently eating simmering food).
                  Afterwards, you are good to go! </p>

                <p> Pot pies are definetly a dish to celebrate, so go out and make a pot pie! You deserve some celebration :-)</p>

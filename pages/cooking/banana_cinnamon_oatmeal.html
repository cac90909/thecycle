    <p>Oatmeal, bananas, and a little bit of cinnamon are all staples in the Chris Castro diet.
    One of the main times that I'll decide to opt for oatmeal as a meal is breakfast.
    This is because breakfast is a time where you are intaking the vital nutrients that you need for the rest of the day,
    and oatmeal provides you the sustenance to do just that.</p>

    <p>Despite popular opinion that we need to
      <a href ="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321545#ten-low-carb-diet-tips" class = "inline-link" target = "_blank">
        cut out all the carbs</a>, I have <b>100% faith</b> in this meal, and of course carbs.
        <a href ="https://www.healthline.com/health/function-of-carbohydrates" class = "inline-link" target = "_blank">
        Carbohydrates </a>are the macronutrient molecule responsible for providing humans <b>energy</b>.
        The anti-carb belief rests on the science that when humans don't consume carbohydrates for energy,
        their body will instead break down fat and utilize that as the main source of energy.</p>
        <p>The low-carb diet has seen success. In fact, in some cases, participants will lose figures nearing
        <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-as-possible#section1" class = "inline-link" target = "_blank">
          10 pounds </a> in the first week of their diet.
          However, losing this amount of weight in this period of time is totally <b>unsafe</b>.
          Changing the composition of the human body <b>takes time</b>. Quick results means something is up.
          A major problem with low-carb diets is that it is <b>not sustainable</b>.
          A
          <a href = "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa022207" class = "inline-link" target = "_blank">
            New England Health Journal Study </a>
          finds that within the first 6 months of low-carb diet, study participants lost more weight than their non-low-carb diet counterparts.
          However, looking at the timespan of the total year, the differences among participants in the study were neglibile.
          Not only that, but low-carb diets have been linked to various issues regarding
          <a href = "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180828085922.htm" class = "inline-link" target = "_blank">
            cardiovascular health</a>, so they are being vetoed by both doctors and nutritionists.</p>
        <p>If your goal is weight loss, then doing some research on the impact of
        <a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763382/" class = "inline-link" target = "_blank">
        macro ratios</a> might just surprise you in that the ratios don't really hold much bearing to your body goals.
        This is because each macronutrient plays a vital role in your body's functioning,
        so your body needs a <b>healthy dosage</b> of each macro.
        What really matters is that you demonstrate some <b>proportion control</b> in the kitchen, aka watch those calories,
        and <b>go to the gym</b> to burn some calories.
        The <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221839/" class = "inline-link" target = "_blank">
          principle of weight loss</a> is very simple at its core.
        The amount of calories you expend must exceed the amount of calories that you intake. Period.</p>

        <p>With that passionate mid-morning rant over and done with, it is time to get to the topic of today's post:
          <b>Banana Cinnamon Oatmeal</b>.
          I've had a lot of time to experiment with an obsurd amount of oatmeal variations and methods to make oatmeal
          (future articles to come), and this style of oatmeal is definetly one that stood out to me because it synergizes so well.</p>
          <p> You want to start out by adding some milk or water to a saucepan and letting it reach the beginning of a slow boil.
            I personally use just a serving (1 cup) of unsweetened almond milk,
            although a lot of people will say that adding 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk gets the consistency of the oatmeal just right.
            </p><p>Next comes the steel cut oats. These oats are extremely healthy for you.
          They have <b>0 grams of added sugar</b> and are made from whole grains that contain the <b>fiber</b> that your body needs.</p>
          <img src = "..\..\images\cooking\banana_cinnamon_oatmeal\steel_cut_oats.jpg"
          alt src = "" class = "content__img">
          <p>
            I will also just add a serving (1/2 cup) of these oats to the boiling almond milk.
            I want to make sure that all of the oats are being cooked, so I will stir around the oats every minute or so.
            Next, I add <b>bananas</b> to the mixture. I will slice up around half a banana and pop them into the boiling sauce pan.
            This adds the sweetness to the meal.
            These bananas are meant to be mashed in the mixture, so that their flavor is being <b>dispersed</b> among the oatmeal.
            Next, I add a tsp of cinnamon.
            After stirring it in the sauce pan,
            you will instantly be able to smell the cinnamon aroma and visualize the light red tint it gives to the oatmeal.
            It's <b>wonderful</b>.
            </p><p> You want to keep stirring the mixture until it reaches your desired consistency.
              If you mess up and your oatmeal becomes too mushy in the saucepan (I've been a victim of this epidemtic far too many times)
              then simply add more milk or water to even out the dry to wet ingredient ratio.
              Additionally, if you find that your oatmeal is not sweet enough, you can always add
              <i>brown sugar, honey, syrup, or chocolate chips</i>
              (although I would personally only choose one of those things to add to this meal).</p>
            <p>After taking your oatmeal off the stove top and transporting it into a bowl, I then add the remaining half of banana
              that was chopped up earlier.
              This helps to <b>enhance</b> the flavor of your oatmeal, so you get the banana taste in every bite,
              but also because it makes your meal aesthetically look good.</p>
            <p>To help make this more of a <b>balanced meal</b>, I would recommend eating this oatmeal alongside a bit of
              Greek Yogurt made from whole milk. That way, you can get a healthy amount of carbs from the oats and banana, and a
              healthy amount of protein and fat from the yogurt. Additionally, you can just add Greek Yogurt into your oatmeal as an additional
              ingredient while it is cooking in the saucepan.
              If you're not a fan of Greek Yogurt, then adding peanut butter to your oatmeal will also do the trick!</p>
              <p> A very easy meal to make and a very tasty meal to consume. A <b>win-win</b>.
                With this meal down the hatch, I always feel ready to conquer the day!
                Like I said, more oatmeal recipes are for sure to come. Thanks for reading!
          </p>

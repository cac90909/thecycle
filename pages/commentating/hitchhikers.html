    <p> I'm going to preface by saying: <b> SPOILER ALERT </b>. Do not read this article if you plan on reading
      The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or if you don't mind the plot being revealed to you!</p>

    <p> I feel the need to write that because I try to be an empathetic blogger. How would I feel if some other blogger decided
      to spoil an amazing book to me? Instant <b> unsubscribe</b>.

      <p> Anyways, let me start by saying, what an <b>amazing book</b>.  I only read the first book in the series, but
        Douglas Adams' writing is so crafty and humurous it will have you entertainined from page to page.
        Anytime an author can get me to laugh while actually keeping the characters and plot of the novel relevant,
        I'm not only intrigued, but also entertainined. </p>
        <p>
        For example, after the <i>Vogons</i>, a galactic species from far away, destroy Earth
        and main characters <i>Arthur Dent</i> and <i>Ford Prefect</i> hitchhike a ride
        on the Vogon Spaceship, they are confronted by <i>Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz</i>, the Captain of the ship.
        As a note of neccessary context,
        the Vogons are notorious for two main things: a <b>major distaste of hitchhikers</b> and, of course, their <b>horrendous poetry</b>.
        Following suit, the Captain and his guards strap Arthur and Ford down in
        the Vogons' designated <i> Poetry Appreciation Chairs </i>, and the Captain begins to read his attrocious pieces of art.
        This scence is full of <b>squirms, spasms, sweating,</b> and a whole lot of <b>suffering</b> on the part of Arthur and Ford,
        which is utterly hilarious to read.
        Who would've known that the most effective torturing device was the same thing that middle schoolers are forced to read out of their
        Literature textbooks during English Class (coincidence?). </p>

        <p> Adams always catches the reader off guard by his seemingly random, yet at the same time extremely coherent, writing.
          For example, in the science fiction world that Adams has created,
          humans are in fact only the <b>third</b> most intelligent species
          that inhabit the planet Earth. Mankind falls behind dolphins and mice as they are the second to most and most
          intellectually capable beings on Earth, respectively.</p><p>
          This fact is learned by Arthur through his conversation with <i>Slartibartfast</i>, a native of the ancient planet
          of <i>Margrathea</i>, who has suddenly woken up from his 10 million year dormancy to aid the brilliant mice in crafting
          the <b>Ultimate Question</b>. See, 10 million years ago, the super computer, named <i> Deep Thought</i>, gave the
          <b>Ultimate Answer</b> to the meaning of life, the Universe, and Everything.
          It took 7 and a half million years for the sentient being to conjecture the answer, but finally the computer arrived
          at the answer. It being the two digit number <b>42</b>.
          As you can imagine, 7 and a half million years of buildup just to hear the answer to the question, "What is 6 times 7?" is
          not quite worth the wait.</p><p>
          The mice, working with the ancient planet builder Margratheans, constructed the planet Earth as an even larger <b>supercomputer</b>
          to come up with the Ultimate Question.
          The Ultimate Question idea was designed to give more context to the answer of 42.
          The galaxy wanted to know what exactly 42 was the answer to, so the concept for the Ultimate Question came about.
          However, this question required a <b>10 million year</b> wait time.
          After the 10 million year wait ellapsed,
          the mice's experiment was about to come to an end and they would arrive at the lo and beholded Ultimate Question,
          but just minutes before the conclusion, the Vogons destroyed planet Earth.
          I don't know about you, but waiting 10 million years for nothing would have <b>totally bummed me out</b>.</p><p>
          Adam's use of randomness in his story is very unique, because it never reaches the point
          of incomprehensible absurdity, rather it just gives a different backstory to everyday elements and pieces them together
          in an engaging to consume series of plot developments. So next time you catch a mouse eating your food, just be nice to it
          because one day it might just spare your life when the end of the Earth comes.
          But probably not, because the mice are actually very impatient and vile beings according to their depiction in this novel.</p>

          <p> The last reason why it is impossible to not love this book is of course because of <i> Marvin</i>, the <b>sickenly depressed</b>
            robot that accompanies the crew of hitchhikers in their journey. Marvin first appears when Arthur and Ford hitchhike
            a ride on <i>Zaphod Beeblebox's</i> stolen spaceship called <i> The Heart of Gold </i>.
            One of the reasons why Marvin exists in this plot is to contrast his constant debbie-downer perspective with the rest of the
            diverse set of personalities that manifest among the other characters, which makes things quite comedic to read.</p><p>

            For example, when Ford returns back to the Heart of Gold after being attacked by galactic policemen, he sparks conversation with
            Marvin who is looking slightly more depressed than his usual state, Douglas Writes: </p>
            <p> - - - </p>
            <p><i>"Don't pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me."</i></p>
            <p><i>"No, I don't." [said Ford]</i></p>
              <p><i>"Yes, you do, everybody does. It's part of the shape of the Universe. I only have to talk to somebody and they begin
                to hate me. Even robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away."</i></p>
            <p><i> "That ship hated me," he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft.</i></p>
              <p><i>"That ship?" said Ford in sudden excitement. "What happened to it? Do you know?"</i></p>
              <p><i>"It hated me because I talked to it."</i></p>
              <p><i>"You talked to it?" exclaimed Ford. "What do you mean you talked to it?"</i></p>
              <p><i>"Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself into its external computer feed.
                I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin.</i></p>
              <p><i>"And what happend?" pressed Ford.</i> </p>
              <p><i>"It committed suicide," said Marvin, and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold. </i></p>
              <p> - - - </p>

              <p>Although in a dark and twisted way, Marvin seems to <b>bring life</b> to this squad with his more than melancholy presence.
                I love it. </p>

              <p> This was only a glimpse into this fantastic novel, since I only wanted to highlight the features that I thought
                were most prominent in the book.
                All in all, I would rate the book a solid <b>4.8/5.0</b> and would for sure reccomend to anyone who is either interested in the
                crazy comedic or non-serious sci-fi genres.
                Thanks for reading and stay safe out there, the Universe is not always what it seems to be...</p>
